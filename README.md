# Road-Accidents-Analysis
Spatial statistical analysis of road accidents

The notebooks illustrate insights extracted from converting the data frame to a geodataframe, using Geopandas. 
The geo dataframe is then used for specific spatial statistical procedures and hypothesis testing such as:
  Spatial data visualization: Hex Bins, KDE, Heatmaps, Data shader
  Point Patterns Analysis: Quadrant statistics, Centrography
  Cluster analysis: K-means and DBSCAN
  Areal Analysis: Global and Local statistics
